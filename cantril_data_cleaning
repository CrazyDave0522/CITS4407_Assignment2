# Description
## This script is designed to clean the data based on certain rules(see below).

# Input: This script expects three .tsv files,
## which are `gdp-vs-happiness.tsv`, `homicide-rate-unodc.tsv`, `life-satisfaction-vs-life-expectancy.tsv`.
## The input files may be in any order.

# Output: A tab-separated data directed to standard output.
## Based on the header line, make sure that the file is a tab-separated format file
## Also based on the header line, report any lines that do not have the same number of cells. (Cells are allowed be empty.)
## Remove the column with header `Continent`.
## Ignore the rows that the country code field is empty.
## Only keep the rows that years from 2011 to 2021, inclusive.
## The output file sent to stdout has rows with the data in the following order (tab separated):
## <Entity/Country> <Code> <Year> <GDP per capita> <Population> <Homicide Rate> <Life Expectancy> <Cantril Ladder score>
